This builds the latest 'master' version of OpenSimulator along with all the Herbal3D
addon-modules into a Docker container. The resulting Docker image has scripts
to run, log, and keep running the OpenSimulator instance. The image starts at
'/usr/opensim/bootOpenSim.sh' which checks for initial setup conditions and
then runs '/usr/opensim/run.opensim.sh' which starts OpenSimulator using 'screen'.

The OpenSimulator setup has a specialized configuration setup. This configuration
setup has:
    -- the default OpenSimDefault.ini and OpenSim.ini in place
    -- all of the usual config-include files nulled out (empty)
    -- a 'bin/config/os-config' file that defines the environment variable 'CONFIG_NAME'
    -- the default 'CONFIG_NAME' of 'docker-standalone'
    -- a set of scripts in 'bin/config' that initialized and configure

'/usr/opensim/bootOpenSim.sh' calls '/usr/opensim/opensim/bin/config/setup.sh' to
configure this particular OpenSimulator instance. 'setup.sh' is called everytime
the Docker image is started. 'setup.sh' uses 'os-config' to define the environment
variable 'CONFIG_NAME' and then uses the information in the same named sub-directory
to setup the configuration files for OpenSimulator.

'bin/config/$CONFIG_NAME/Includes.ini' is copied into 'bin/config'. This will be read
by OpenSimulator on startup and replaces all of the usual configuration includes.
There will usually be a 'bin/config/$CONFIG_NAME/config-includes' that models the
usual OpenSimulator configuration directory.

This configuration design means that the complete OpenSimulator setup and
runtime configuration can be replaced by replacing the directory
'/usr/opensim/opensim/bin/config'. This allows mounting a configuration directory
for the Docker container to completely replace the setup and configuration.

Note that there are secrets needed to configure and run OpenSimulator.
These are stored in a 'ccrypt' encrypted file. Read the comments in
'/usr/opensim/opensim/bin/config/os-secrets' for how to encrypt secrets.
The container is initially run with the 'CONFIGKEY' environment variable
which is the key for decrypting the secrets file.

PROCESS:

Setup build environment:
    cd opensim-herbal3d
    docker build -t opensim-herbal3d .

Run the container:
