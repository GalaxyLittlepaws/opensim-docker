These configuration files are copied on top of the configuration
files in the OpenSimulator distribution.

These configuration files are empty (do nothing) and thus disable
most all configuration that is standardly included by the OpenSimulator
base configuration files.

Configuration is thus:
Read OpenSimDefault.ini
Read OpenSim.ini (an exact copy of OpenSim.ini.example)
    This includes these empty files in config-include
Read config/Includes.ini
    This includes the files for the actual configuration
