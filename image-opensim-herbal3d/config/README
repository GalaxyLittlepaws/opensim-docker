CONFIGURATION ON DOCKER IMAGE

The OpenSim docker image is setup with most of the normal configuration nulled out.
The file 'bin/OpenSim.ini.example' has been copied to 'bin/OpenSim.ini' but all
the files that are normally included (from 'bin/config-include') have been emptied so none
of the normal network, grid, database, or cache setup is present.

The configuration relies on the feature that OpenSimulator reads all INI files
in the 'bin/config' directory.

The default installation is for a single region, standalone, sqlite based version
of OpenSimulator. 'bin/config/setup.sh' copies 'bin/config/standalone/Includes.ini'
into 'bin/config'. This file includes all the INI files
needed to configure same. 'Includes.ini' includes files from the 'standalone'
directory. This includes 'Standalone.ini' and 'StandaloneCommon.ini' to do their
normal configuration. It finally includes 'Misc.ini' which specifies parameters
that overlay everything previous for final setting and over-riding.

Edit 'Misc.ini' for specific simulator settings.

When the docker image is run, the startup script also checks for 'bin/config/setup.sh'
and, if it exists, it is executed. This allows initializing databases and any
passwords that need to be set in the configuration files.

One can completely override the configuration included in this Docker image build
by mounting a bind volume over '/home/opensim/opensim/bin/config'. For this case,
all normal OpenSimulator configuration is replaced by whatever one puts in
that 'config' directory.
