# File of configuration parameters that are applied when OpenSimulator is run.

# When run, the OpenSimulator selects one of the available runtime configurations.
# This is selected by CONFIG_NAME which is the name of a subdirectory under
#     '/config/'. Thus, one OpenSImulator binary can have several runtime
#     configurations (standalone, grid, ...).
