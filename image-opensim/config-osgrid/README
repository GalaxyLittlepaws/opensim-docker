CONFIGURATION ON DOCKER IMAGE

This directory will be mounted in `bin/config` and the running simulator will
read the `Includes.ini` file. This file imports environment variables, sets
global "Const" parameters, and then includes the necessary INI files (like
`StandaloneCommon.ini`, `osslEnable.ini`, ...).

Most of the files in `config-include` are copies of the standard files from
the repository. In this setup, most parameters are changed by the overrides
that happen in `Final.ini` which is the last INI files read (and thus anything
specified in `Final.ini` overrides anything that came before.

The convention used herein is to use the unchanged INI files from the repository 
and to make any changes and additions in `Final.ini`.

When the docker image is run, the startup script also checks for 'bin/config/setup.sh'
and, if it exists, it is executed. The included version adds `os-secrets` to the
running environment so those values can be used in the INI files (see the
"[Environment]" section in `Includes.ini`. So, things like database passwords
only need to be entered into `os-secrets` and they will be used in the INI files.
You don't need to change any database configuration in any of the INI files.
