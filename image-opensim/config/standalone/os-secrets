# File of secrets for the build and run images.
# This file is a template of the values to use.
# NEVER, NEVER EVER CHECK-IN the version with the real values!!

# The configuration files look for the file 'os-secrets.crypt' and, when
#    found, runs 'ccrypt' using the password from the environment variable
#    "CONFIGKEY". So, edit this file and do:
#           cp os-secrets tempFile
#           <edit 'tempFile' adding real passwords>
#           ccrypt -e -E "$CONFIGKEY" < tempFile > os-secrets.crypt
#           rm tempFile
#    or (exposing the key in the bash history):
#           ccrypt -e -K thekey < os-secrets > os-secrets.crypt
#
# Later, if you need to review the passwords, decrypt the file with:
#           ccrypt -d -E "$CONFIGKEY" < os-secrets.crypt

# If this next variable is defined, MYSQL is configured
#export MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=ksdjfalkcxviowerw
export MYSQL_DB_SOURCE=localhost
export MYSQL_DB_DB=opensim
export MYSQL_DB_USER=opensim
export MYSQL_DB_USER_PASSWORD=dbpassword

export OPENSIM_USER=opensim
export OPENSIM_USER_PASSWORD=unknownPassword

# The following are used to initialize estate if running standalone
export DEFAULT_ESTATE_NAME="Donalds Estate"
export DEFAULT_ESTATE_OWNER="Donald Duck"
export PW_FOR_DEFAULT_ESTATE_OWNER=anotherUnknownPassword

# Did I mention that one should NEVER, NEVER, EVER check-in a version
#     with the real passwords in it?
