# Overall parameters for building and storing the OpenSimulator image.
# This file is 'source'ed in Bash scripts and used by docker-compose.

# While nearly everything can be moved into this file, these are the
#    top level build and run configurations but most of the configuration
#    happens in the config-$OS_CONFIG directory.

# NOTE: the assignment format is restricted so it works as a Bash
#    assignment file and a docker-compose env-file
